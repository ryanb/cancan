      # Sets up a before filter which loads the model resource into an instance variable.
      # For example, given an ArticlesController it will load the current article into the @article
      # instance variable. It does this by either calling Article.find(params[:id]) or
      # Article.new(params[:article]) depending upon the action. The index action will
      # automatically set @articles to Article.accessible_by(current_ability).
      #
      # If a conditions hash is used in the Ability, the +new+ and +create+ actions will set
      # the initial attributes based on these conditions. This way these actions will satisfy

      #
      # That first argument is optional and will default to the singular name of the controller.
      # A hash of options (see below) can also be passed to this method to further customize it.
      #
      # See load_and_authorize_resource to automatically authorize the resource too.
      #
      # Options:
      # [:+only+]
      #   Only applies before filter to given actions.
      #
      # [:+except+]
      #   Does not apply before filter to given actions.
      #
      # [:+through+]
      #   Load this resource through another one. This should match the name of the parent instance variable or method.
      #
      # [:+through_association+]
      #   The name of the association to fetch the child records through the parent resource. This is normally not needed
      #   because it defaults to the pluralized resource name.
      #
      # [:+shallow+]
      #   Pass +true+ to allow this resource to be loaded directly when parent is +nil+. Defaults to +false+.
      #
      # [:+singleton+]
      #   Pass +true+ if this is a singleton resource through a +has_one+ association.
      #
      # [:+parent+]
      #   True or false depending on if the resource is considered a parent resource. This defaults to +true+ if a resource
      #   name is given which does not match the controller.
      #
      # [:+class+]
      #   The class to use for the model (string or constant).
      #
      # [:+instance_name+]
      #   The name of the instance variable to load the resource into.
      #
      # [:+find_by+]
      #   Find using a different attribute other than id. For example.
      #
      #     load_resource :find_by => :permalink # will use find_by_permalink!(params[:id])
      #
      # [:+id_param+]
      #   Find using a param key other than :id. For example:
      #
      #     load_resource :id_param => :url # will use find(params[:url])
      #
      # [:+collection+]
      #   Specify which actions are resource collection actions in addition to :+index+. This
      #   is usually not necessary because it will try to guess depending on if the id param is present.
      #
      #     load_resource :collection => [:sort, :list]
      #
      # [:+new+]
      #   Specify which actions are new resource actions in addition to :+new+ and :+create+.
      #   Pass an action name into here if you would like to build a new resource instead of
      #   fetch one.
      #
      #     load_resource :new => :build
      #
      # [:+prepend+]

      # something like the following.
      #
      #   authorize!(params[:action].to_sym, @article || Article)

      #   name is given which does not match the controller.
      #
      # [:+class+]
      #   The class to use for the model (string or constant). This passed in when the instance variable is not set.
      #   Pass +false+ if there is no associated class for this resource and it will use a symbol of the resource name.
      #
      # [:+instance_name+]
      #   The name of the instance variable for this resource.
