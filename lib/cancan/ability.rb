module CanCan

  # This module is designed to be included into an Ability class. This will
  # provide the "can" methods for defining and checking abilities.
  #
  #   class Ability
  #     include CanCan::Ability
  #
  #     def initialize(user)
  #       if user.admin?
  #         can :access, :all

  module Ability
    # Check if the user has permission to perform a given action on an object.
    #
    #   can? :destroy, @project
    #
    # You can also pass the class instead of an instance (if you don't have one handy).
    #
    #   can? :create, :projects
    #
    # Nested resources can be passed through a hash, this way conditions which are
    # dependent upon the association will work when using a class.
    #
    #   can? :create, @category => :projects
    #
    # Not only can you use the can? method in the controller and view (see ControllerAdditions),
    # but you can also call it directly on an ability instance.
    #
    #   ability.can? :destroy, @project
    #
    # This makes testing a user's abilities very easy.

    #     assert ability.can?(:destroy, Project.new(:user => user))
    #     assert ability.cannot?(:destroy, Project.new)
    #   end
    #
    # Also see the RSpec Matchers to aid in testing.

    # Defines which abilities are allowed using two arguments. The first one is the action
    # you're setting the permission for, the second one is the class of object you're setting it on.
    #
    #   can :update, :articles
    #
    # You can pass an array for either of these parameters to match any one.
    # Here the user has the ability to update or destroy both articles and comments.
    #
    #   can [:update, :destroy], [:articles, :comments]
    #
    # You can pass :all to match any object and :access to match any action. Here are some examples.
    #
    #   can :access, :all
    #   can :update, :all
    #   can :access, :projects
    #
    # You can pass a hash of conditions as the third argument. Here the user can only see active projects which he owns.
    #
    #   can :read, :projects, :active => true, :user_id => user.id
    #
    # See ActiveRecordAdditions#accessible_by for how to use this in database queries. These conditions
    # are also used for initial attributes when building a record in ControllerAdditions#load_resource.
    #
    # If the conditions hash does not give you enough control over defining abilities, you can use a block
    # along with any Ruby code you want.
    #
    #   can :update, :projects do |project|
    #     project.groups.include?(user.group)
    #   end
    #
    # If the block returns true then the user has that :update ability for that project, otherwise he
    # will be denied access. The downside to using a block is that it cannot be used to generate
    # conditions for database queries.
    #
    # IMPORTANT: Neither a hash of conditions or a block will be used when checking permission on a symbol.
    #
    #   can :update, :projects, :priority => 3
    #   can? :update, :projects # => true
    #
    # If you pass no arguments to +can+, the action, class, and object will be passed to the block and the
    # block will always be executed. This allows you to override the full behavior if the permissions are
    # defined in an external source such as the database.
