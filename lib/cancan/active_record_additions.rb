      # Returns a scope which fetches only the records that the passed ability
      # can perform a given action on. The action defaults to :read. This
      # is usually called from a controller and passed the +current_ability+.

      #   @articles = Article.accessible_by(current_ability)
      #
      # Here only the articles which the user is able to read will be returned.
      # If the user does not have permission to read any articles then an empty
      # result is returned. Since this is a scope it can be combined with any
      # other scopes or pagination.
      #
      # An alternative action can optionally be passed as a second argument.
      #
      #   @articles = Article.accessible_by(current_ability, :update)

      # Here only the articles which the user can update are returned. This
      # internally uses Ability#conditions method, see that for more information.
